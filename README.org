Inspired by the practice of "swallowing the frog," this Python script is designed to help you plan your day by identifying and prioritizing your most important tasks --- that is, your "frogs."

** How It Works
The script prompts you to list all of your tasks for the day. Then, it asks you to identify your most important tasks. These are your "frogs". It then prompts you to rank your "frogs" in order of priority. The tasks are then written to a text file in your specified directory in org-mode format, with your frogs highlighted.

** Concepts
Swallowing the Frog is a concept popularized by Brian Tracy in his book Eat That Frog! The "frog" is your most challenging task of your day---the one you are most likely to procrastinate on, but also the one that can have the greatest positive impact on your life.

The script incorporates several productivity concepts:

- Swallowing the Frog: Starting your day by focusing on the most challenging task that can have the greatest positive impact on your day.
- Prioritizing: determining the order of tasks based on their importance and urgency.
- Avoiding Experiential Avoidance: This is a concept from psychology that refers to a person's attempt to avoid thoughts, feelings, memories, physical sensations, and other internal experiences---even when doing so creates harm in the long-run.
- Working on the Most Important Thing: Directing your energy and time towards the tasks that align with your goals and add the most value.
- Accepting Discomfort: Understanding that discomfort is a natural part of life and work, and facing it can lead to accomplishing significant tasks and goals.
- Not Getting Sidetracked by the Easy Task: Resisting the temptation to do easier, less important tasks ("bikeshedding") instead of focusing on the more challenging, critical ones.

** Requirements
- Python 3
- The PyInquirer Python library
- The termcolor Python library

** Installation
1. Install Python 3 if you haven't already.
2. Install the required Python libraries with pip:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  pip install PyInquirer termcolor
  #+END_SRC
3. Download the script and save it to a location on your system.

** Usage
1. Run the script in your terminal:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  python3 /path/to/script.py
  #+END_SRC
2. Follow the prompts to enter your tasks and select your frogs.
3. The script will output your tasks and frogs to a .org file, display the file in the terminal, and copy the contents to your clipboard.
